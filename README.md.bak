# üç∞ CakePHP Simple CRUD Example (Windows CMD Setup)

This is a minimal **CakePHP 5 CRUD application** for beginners.  
It demonstrates how to create, read, update, and delete records using the **Articles** table.

---

## üöÄ Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher  
- Composer  
- MySQL or MariaDB  
- Windows CMD or PowerShell terminal

---

## üì¶ Installation

Open **CMD** and run the following commands:

```cmd
composer create-project --prefer-dist "cakephp/app:^5.0" my_cake_app
cd my_cake_app
composer require --dev cakephp/bake
‚öôÔ∏è Database Setup
Create a new MySQL database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE cake_crud;
Open config\app_local.php and update the database settings:

php
Copy code
'Datasources' => [
    'default' => [
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'username' => 'your_db_user',
        'password' => 'your_db_password',
        'database' => 'cake_crud',
        'driver' => Cake\Database\Driver\Mysql::class,
        'encoding' => 'utf8mb4',
    ],
],
Create the articles table:

sql
Copy code
USE cake_crud;

CREATE TABLE articles (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  body TEXT,
  created DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  modified DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
üß† Generate CRUD Using Bake
Use the built-in CakePHP Bake tool to generate everything automatically:

cmd
Copy code
php bin\cake.php bake all Articles
This will create:

src\Model\Table\ArticlesTable.php

src\Controller\ArticlesController.php

templates\Articles\index.php

templates\Articles\add.php

templates\Articles\edit.php

templates\Articles\view.php

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Development Server
Start the built-in CakePHP server:

cmd
Copy code
php bin\cake.php server
Then open your browser and go to:
üëâ http://localhost:8765/articles

üß± CRUD Operations
Action	URL	Description
List all articles	/articles	Displays all records
Add new article	/articles/add	Add a new record
Edit article	/articles/edit/{id}	Update existing record
Delete article	/articles/delete/{id}	Remove a record

‚ö° Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
'php' is not recognized	Add PHP to your Windows PATH
'composer' is not recognized	Add Composer to PATH
Database connection failed	Verify credentials in config\app_local.php
Permission denied	Run CMD as Administrator
Class not found: Bake	Run composer require --dev cakephp/bake

üí° Notes
Default server port is 8765 (change with -p flag if needed).

You can also use bin\cake.bat (on Windows) instead of php bin\cake.php.

To rebuild or add more tables, just update your database and run php bin\cake.php bake all TableName.
